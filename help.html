    Hopefully the site is easy for you to use but if you need some help just read below:
    You can begin by selecting a team from the Teams drop down menu in the top left of the screen.
    Then drag the players you into the corresponding lineup slots. 
    Above the lineup are the playable positions you can assign to each player. 
    If you drag in the wrong position or want to make an adjustment just drag a new position over the old one.
    On the right hand side stats are shown for the league wide average of lineups.
    As you drag players into the linup their stats will help populate the lineups overall stats.
    You can then drag three lineup stats into the slots beside the lineup that best represent your lineup.
    The reset button will reset the entire middle section, and reset stats will simply reset the three stat slots 
    incase you made some adjustments.
    Hope you enjoy and have fun building some unique lineups before gameday!
